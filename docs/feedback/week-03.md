# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute-taker.

#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was clear and well-structured.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very good

Feedback: Action points are vague, try to make them more concrete in the future. The minutes were well-structured and covered all important points.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: For the most part, the meeting was kept on track, but there were a few times when the team veered off topic. The chair could have been more assertive in keeping the team on track. They did ensure that everyone had a chance to speak and that the meeting was well-structured.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The team was very respectful and supportive of each other. They were all very engaged and contributed to the discussion. However, towards the end, the concentration levels fell, and it felt like some people weren't fully engaged. 80% of the meeting was very productive, but the last 20% was less so.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: The team has showcased some progress on the product, but it is not yet shippable. However, that does make sense, given that the majority of the work was done on the backend of the project - work is being done, but the front-end is not yet ready.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The work was distributed evenly, and everyone contributed to the discussion. The team was very supportive of each other and worked well together, and the attitude seems to be good.

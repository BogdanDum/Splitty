#### Agenda

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was clear and well-structured.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: Action points are vague, try to make them more concrete in the future. Additionally, they do not contain assigned work for all team members, as only 2 are actually named in them. The minutes were well-structured and covered all important points.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team was in charge of the meeting, and the atmosphere was constructive.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: So far, it seems like everyone achieved their goals for the past week, and the contributions are more or less equal between team members, though they are some discrepancies.

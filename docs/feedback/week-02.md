# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute-taker.


#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: In the future, add the list of attendees into the agenda, and do more granular time division. Given that our meetings are supposed to last 45 minutes, having a single point taking 75% of the meeting time is indicative of a point that should be split up further  .


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: N/A

Feedback: There was no minute taker in W1.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair did make sure all topics were covered, but did not ensure that proper agreements were made. The time distribution roughly followed the agenda.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The team was in charge of the meeting, but some people contributed noticeably less than others. The athmosphere was constructive and respectful, and participants did pay attention to each other.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: While there was not much to showcase, you could've showcased everyone being able to run the demo application.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Insufficient (N/A)

Feedback: No activity in the repository.

# Notes

## Agenda item 1: Code of conduct and knock-out criteria

- Good job with the code of conduct, the feedback on it was very good
- Not everyone has succeeded in meeting the knock-out criteria, thus some clarifications were made:
  - Apart from creating the MR and merging another MR, everyone needs to approve the reviewed MR through the **Approve button**
  - Again, make sure to have at least **3** commits, **100** lines of Java code and a comment of minimum **100** characters

## Agenda item 2: Progress during last week

### Code contribution
- Each person managed to do the assigned task
- The following were added: controllers for the classes Event, Expense and Participant, Event page and some functionality, Admin page and a Currency converter

### Closing issues
- When creating a MR, make sure to also resolve or close the corresponding issue in order to be more organized
- Assigning a branch to the issue will close it automatically

### Improvements and bugs of the current app
- The language persists when you restart the app
- Bug: it does not show the previously joined events
- No back button on the Event page

### Agenda item 3: Development
- Focus more on the frontend this week, as well as testing for it (integration tests)
- Implement websockets throughout the project
- Converting the endpoints
- Tasks regarding the admin
- Manage to see all events and event codes
- Since there is no official meeting next week, we have established to organise one on Thursday (14/03/2024), hour to be discussed

## Other key points
- Try to merge more often and earlier
- Have a MR that works on its own rather than having something really complex that fails at the end of the week


## Action points
- More focus on frontend and making sure the backend works fine
- Don't forget to do the 2 assignments (Buddycheck, Tasks and Planning) by **Friday 11:59 PM**
- Try to start working earlier to avoid having to review code on Sunday

##### Feedback from the TA
This is the feedback we received after showcasing our product to the TA:
- There should be feedback for the user for key actions, like adding a participant
and deleting stuff.
- Multimodal representations should be made (e.g. icons)
- Make the language template downloadable
- Make sure to check out all the requirements step by step (follow rubrics)
- Feedback regarding self-reflection assignment: 
Make sure you explain in detail, someone else has to understand your thoughts and
the entirety of the situation. Follow the template and the rubrics carefully.
- Product Pitch and Oral Examination tips:
Questions can regard the entire project. Make sure you understand every aspect. 
Defend your design choices. Expect curveballs from the lecturer.

##### Continuation
Priorities:
- Open Debts functionality
- Usability of the project
- Using the feedback of the TA
- Maybe give the program a logo
- More test coverage

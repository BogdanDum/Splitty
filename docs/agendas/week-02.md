# Notes

## Agenda item 1: Code of conduct
- Shared team values: communication, informing everyone of what you're doing, having a working program at all times in main branch (do feature branches)
- Assignment description: make a user friendly application
- Target or ambition leveL: striving for a good grade if possible
- Planning: letting teammates  know if you might not reach the deadline ahead of time,
  discussed the idea of having a project manager but decided to manage together for now,
  try to come up with tasks and assign them to everyone during meetings, keep track of them in Gitlab issues
- Behaviour: be professional, work out disagreements as a group
- Communication: official matters on Mattermost, other stuff on Whatsapp and Discord
- Commitment: give feedback to teammates' work and to chairs and minute takers at the end of the meeting
- Decision-making: try to reach a group consensus if a conflict occurs
- Dealing with conflicts: depends a lot on the conflict
- Consequences: if late to a meeting for more than 10 minutes, bring cookies next time
- Outside Collaboration: if there is a need for an extra meeting, do it

This should be expanded on later.

## Agenda item 2

- Kajus will make the database conceptual schema by Friday and it should be inspected by everyone once it is done
- Should define some key points for what should the program look and feel like
  and make rough UI mock-ups this week but haven't decided on how
- The person responsible is free to choose the tool
- Will be discussed as we go
- The deadline for mock-ups and schema is on Friday
- Manage together for now, come back to this question if that does not work out

## Other key points

- Keep track of everything in Gitlab issues and milestones
- Checking up on others' progress if their tasks are similar
- UI mock-ups can wait, use the mock-ups in the backlog file as placeholder
- Another meeting this week might be needed to sort out the tasks, the knock-out criteria for writing code is in effect this week
- Checkstyle rules were added to the agenda during the meeting but were forgotten

## Action points

- Urgently decide on tasks
- Kajus makes the database conceptual schema by friday
- Discuss on how and who should do the mock-ups
